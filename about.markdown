Hi there,

My name is Danylo Hrudzinsky (or just Dani Jug).

For over than decade I've been involved in the commercial software development acting in various different roles - from the developer in small in-house development team to system architect in enterprise product. One day i was asked by a colleague to give him a link to my blog about software development... 

Well, then I hadn't found any reason not to start such blog.
Especially given the dept to community, grown during mine development career.
