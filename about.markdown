Hi there,

My name is Danylo Hrudzinsky (or just Dani Jug).

For more than a decade I've been involved in the commercial software development acting in various different roles - from the developer in a small in-house development team to system architect in an enterprise product. One day I was asked by a colleague to give him a link to my blog about software development... 

Well, then I didn't find a meaningful reason not to start such a blog.
